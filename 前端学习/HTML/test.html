        <!--<h1>Basic HTML Animals </h1>


        <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>
        
        <h2>The Llama</h2>
        
        <p>
            Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
        </p>
        <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
        <P>
            The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.

        <h1>Looking at lists</h1>

            <p>Turn the following list of my favorite vegetables into an unordered list.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cucumber</li>                Broccoli
                <li>Asparagus</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First knock on the door</li>
                <li>When prompted, say the magic word</li>
                <li>Wait for at least 5 seconds</li>
                <li>Turn the handle and push</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are <strong>two</strong> things I care about â€” music and friends. Someday I <em>maybe</em> be able to get my friends interested in each other, and my music!</p>
